# Thesis Scripts  

The main purpose of this repository is to document all of the scripts written and/or used by myself for my masters thesis, "Dynamics of protein networks exhibiting complex behavior". My mentors were Steven Massey - Dept. of Biology, Julian Velev - Dept. of Physics, and Lhutful Bari Bhuiyan - Dept. of Physics all from the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus.  

A copy of the work can be found at: http://repositorio.upr.edu:8080/jspui/bitstream/10586%20/564/1/Thesis%20-%20July%20-%20Final.pdf.
